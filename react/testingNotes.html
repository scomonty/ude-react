react - lifecycle
instance of component created
initialize state object and assign this.state property

react calls render method

returns jsx gets rendered to page as html

update state object

react calls render again
jsx gets re-rendered to page as html


constructor - good place to do one time setup
render - avoid doing anything besides returning jsx
componentDidMount (content visible on screen) - good place to do data loading
componentDidUpdate (sit and wait for updates) - do more data loading when state/props change
componentWillUnmount (sit and wait until this component is no longer shown) - good place to do cleanup esp non-react stuff


rarely used - 3
shouldComponentUpdate
getDerivedStateFromProps
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate

how long is contact?
what would normal week look like? set hours within a day?
what OS do they use?  will it be provided?
is this more of a design or dev position?

'what we do' wish it would expand to full width and have some bullets

Are willing to have the tough conversations if we believe an idea is not right for you
