redux

cycle - action creator  --  action  --  dispatch  --  reducers  --  state

action creator - function that returns JS object  - refered to action
action has 'type' and 'payload' properties  - purpose to describe change to make to data inside application

dispatch  -  take action, make copies, and pass off to orther parts of application

reducers -  fuction that takes in action ; process action, return data

state  -  all info gets consolidated inside state object

// action creator example
const createPolicy = (name, amount) => {
	return {
	// this is the action
	type: 'Create a policy',
	payload: {
	//information about what is being sumbitted
	name: name,
	amount: amount
	}
	}
}

const createClaim = (name, amount) => {
	return {
	type: 'CREATE_CLAIM',
	payload: {
	name, amount
	}
	}
}

const deletePolicy = (name) => {
	return {
	type: 'DELETE_POLICY',
	payload: {
	name: name
	}
	}
}



// REDUCERS
const claimsHistory = ( oldListOfClaims = [], action ) => {
	if (action.type === 'CREATE_CLAIM') {
		return [...oldListOfClaims, action.payload];
	}
	// if not a create claim action
	return oldListOfClaims;
}


// REDUX STORE
const { createStore, combineReducers } = Redux

const ourDepartments = combineReducers({
//names of reducers that were created
	accounting: accounting,
	claimsHistory: claimsHistory,
	policies: policites
});

// create the store with all reducers included
const store = createStore(ourDepartments);

const action = createPolicy('Scott', 600)

//call our dispatcher
store.dispatch(action);
